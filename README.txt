Perfecto
========

The Perfecto module allows compositions to be floated over your web page to
quickly and accurately calibrate theme CSS.

Description
===========

Save your composition from Photoshop, FireWorks etc to jpg or png, upload them
using admin/settings/perfecto, move your mouse to top right corner
of viewport and choose one of the files. A semi-transparent version
of your composition will show up. You can move it around by:
1) holding down ctrl + left mouse button and moving mouse,
2) clicking on arrow icons in the control panel,
3) pressing arrow keys on your keyobard while holding down ctrl (optionally
   hold down shift key to move composition by 10px).

Because composition is actually under your page, any links, selects etc are
clickable (just release ctrl).
